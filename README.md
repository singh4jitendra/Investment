Project Brief -
==============
You work for Spark Funds, an asset management company. Spark Funds wants to make investments in a few companies. The CEO of Spark Funds wants to understand the global trends in investments so that she can take the investment decisions effectively.
 

Business and Data Understanding -
=================================
Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:

- It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment

- It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in

- For your analysis, consider a country to be English speaking only if English is one of the official languages in that country
